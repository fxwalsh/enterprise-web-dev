# Express Applications

We'll now add some static content to our web server. Up to now you've used **http-server** which is fine for prototyping HTML. We'll now move to Express, the package we installed in the last section. Express is a richer web app package and provides a nice high level approach to serving up static content. It's based around the idea of creating an Express "app" that you can easily configure. One of the configuration options allows you to specify the location of your publicly available content such as static HTML, CSS, client-side Javascript files etc.

- In your *node-lab-1* folder, create the following folder structure:
```
+public
    |-javascript
    |-stylesheets
```
- Add the solution to *lab2* from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxtnCYpIWp3Da215RGhIT0JyYjQ/view?usp=sharing). Make sure the files are in the public folder.
- In node-lab-1, replace the contents of **server.js** with the following javascript:

```javascript

import config from './config';
import express from 'express';

const server = express();

server.use(express.static('public'));

server.listen(config.port, () => {
  console.info('Express listening on port', config.port);
});

```

- Now test the application as before in a browser. It should display the default resource (index.html) from the public folder.

#### Simple Routing
Express gives us an easy way of mapping specific URL paths to Javascript functions. You will now replicate the functionality from the "Hello World" section so that a HTTP GET request for the URL path  '/greeting/' will respond with "Hello World". Modify the server.js by adding an ``app.get([route],[callback function])``.
- Modify the server.js script to include a route for /greeting that responds with "hello world".

```javascript
import express from 'express';
//Add greeting module
import greeting from './greeting';
//create an express app
const app = express();

// Configure the app to serve up content from public directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

//add route for /greeting
app.get('/greeting',(req, res)=>{
  const language = req.headers["accept-language"];
  const resp_language = greeting[language]?language:'en';
  res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  res.end(greeting[resp_language]);
});

app.listen(config.port)

// Put a friendly message on the terminal
console.log("Server running on port " +config.port);
```
###Commit and Push to Github
Commit your changes using git as before and push your changes to your remote repository.

```script
git add -A
git commit -m "Changed to express app"
git push origin master
```

### Contacts API

We wish to replace the API used in last weeks lap with an Express API. Ultimately this will allow us to connect to a Mongo database and allow for a more realistic API that can cope with large volumes of data you would expect in a production environment.

Create a new folder called **api** in **node-lab-1**. Create another folder called **contacts** in **api**. Your folder structure should look as follows:

```
+node-lab-1
    |-api
       |-contacts
```

As before we will use test data for the time being. Create a new file called **contacts.js** in the contacts folder and add the following code:

```javascript
var contacts = [
  {
    "name": "Contact 1",
    "address": "123 Test St",
    "phone_number": "132-3212"
  },
  {
    "name": "Contact 2",
    "address": "23 Main St",
    "phone_number": "934-4329"
  },
  {
    "name": "Contact 3",
    "address": "4 Lower St",
    "phone_number": "432-5832"
  },
  {
    "name": "Contact 4",
    "address": "49 Upper Street",
    "phone_number": "934-4290"
  }
];

export default contacts;
```

- Also in the contacts folder, create a new file called **index.js** and enter the folowing javascript:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import contacts from './contacts';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ contacts: contacts });
});

export default router;
```


- Now update **server.js** to use the new contacts routing script by replacing the contents with the following code

```javascript
import config from './config';
import express from 'express';
import contactsRouter from './api/contacts';

const server = express();

server.use('/api/contacts', contactsRouter);
server.use(express.static('public'));

server.listen(config.port, config.host, () => {
  console.info('Express listening on port', config.port);
});
```

Now test the application again by doing a HTTP GET on localhost/api/contacts. You should see something simlilar toe the following:

![Get contact details](./img/contacts_api_1.png)

### Challange
Try to include in  server-side route for the Hacker News lab you did last week. Follow the same procedure as above.

> hint: create a new folder in api for Hacker News. Create a routing script and update server.js to add the Hacker News route.
