# Get Git

![git](./img/git1.png)

#### Windows OS
If you're on Windows, download the  **GitHub Desktop**, from [here](https://desktop.github.com/) which includes Git, and use the Git Shell for your terminal.


#### Mac
You can install Git automatically. To do this, open the Terminal application from spotlight and type `git`. This will prompt Git to install the rest of the command line tools for Git. This should only take a few minutes. It will ask if you would like to download Xcode, which you can ignore.

#### Linux

You can use the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. For Fedora use:

``
$ sudo yum install git-all
``

For Debian-based distributions use:

``
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
``

## Clone a Repository

### Clone the samples repository
Select a location on your machine where you would like to keep the code examples taken from the weekly talks. Open a terminal window in that location and clone the samples repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/fxwalsh/ewd_samples_2017.git
```

This should create a new folder called *ewd_samples_2017*. Open the folder and you should see the node samples from the lecture slides. We will use this repository to update our sample code as the module progresses. You will need to *pull* the repository each week to get the latest samples.

## Create a repository
A repository is essentially a project. You can imagine it as a project's folder with all the related files inside of it.
![git repos](./img/repos.png)
You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even a single letter in a single file changed -- all of it's tracked and time stamped by Git. That's version control.

You're going to create a new folder and initialize it as a Git repository.
Make a new folder

``$ mkdir ewd_labs_2017``

To go into that folder:

``$ cd ewd_labs_2017``

To create a new Git instance for a project:

``$ git init``

It will just return you to a new line. If you want to be double-sure that it's a Git repository, type ``git status`` and if it doesn't return 'fatal: Not a git repository...', you've got a local repo!

#Add to the repository
Open a text editor. Now write a couple of lines of text:

```
#Enterprise Web Development practical lab repository
```

and save the file as readme.md in the 'ewd-labs' folder.

### Status, Add and Commit Changes
Next check the status of your repository to find out if there have been changes. Below in this terminal, you should still be within the 'ewd-labs' you created. See if there are changes listed:

```$ git status```

Then add the file you just created to the files you'd like to commit (aka save) to change.

```$ git add readme.md```

Finally, commit those changes to the repository's history with a short description of the updates.

```$ git commit -m "<your commit message>"```

### Make More Changes

Now add another line to *readme.md* and save.

In terminal, you can view the difference between the file now and how it was at your last commit.

```$ git diff```

Now with what you just learned above, commit this latest change.
