# Node.js

You should have node on your machine already. Check by entering the following in a terminal window: ``$ node -v``. If it does not recognise the command you probably need to install node.  

If you do not have Node.js installed in you machine, please go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) and download/install node for your platform. To check if node is working, open a command line/terminal window on your machine and enter ``node -v``. IT should respond as follows:
```
> node -v
v4.x.x
``` 
The work for this lab has been tested with node version 0.13.0 but should be ok with later versions.


##The "Hello World" HTTP Server

We will be using node as a web application platform. In this step we'll set up a simple HTTP server that responds to every request with the plain text message "Hello World". Create a new folder called *node-lab-1* in the *ewd-labs* folder. Create a new file called "app1.js" in the *node-lab-1* folder  with the following contents:

```javascript
// Load the http module to create an http server.
var http = require('http');

// Configure our HTTP server to respond with Hello World to all requests.
var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.end("Hello World\n");
});

// Listen on port 8000, IP defaults to 127.0.0.1
server.listen(8000);

// Put a friendly message on the terminal
console.log("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/");
```

In the first line, we include the http core module and assign it to a variable called ``http``. Next we assign a variable called ``server`` from the ``http.createServer(...)`` function. The argument passed into this call is the function that is called whenever an http request comes in.
Finally we call ``server.listen(8000)`` to tell node.js the port on which we want our server to run. 
To run the server open a terminal/command window in the lab6 folder and enter:

```
node app1.js
```
Now open your browser to 'http://localhost:8000'. You should see the following:

The connection function is invoked with a **req** and **res** object. The **req** object represents the HTTP request and is a readable stream that emits 'data' events for each incoming piece of data (like a form submission or file upload). The ***res*** object represents the HTTP response and is used to send data back to the client. In our case we are simply sending a 200 OK header, as well as the body 'Hello World'.

###Nodes Module system
Node.js provides a simple module system that lets you structure your program into different files. In our *app1.js* example, we use the core http module to create our HTTP service. You can also write your own modules. When creating a module, this can be interpreted as moving all related functions into a file. For example, update your *app1.js* file as follows:


```javascript
// Load the http module to create an http server.
var http = require('http');
// Load the greeting module to provide the greeting.
var greeting = require('./greeting');

// Configure our HTTP server to respond with Hello World to all requests.
var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.end(greeting.english());
});

// Listen on port 8000, IP defaults to 127.0.0.1
server.listen(8000);

// Put a friendly message on the terminal
console.log("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8001/");
```

Now create a new file called 'greeting.js' in the same folder with the following content:

```javascript
//Greeting in English
exports.english = function(){
	return "Hello World!";
}
//Greeting in French
exports.french = function(){
	return "Bonjour tout le Monde!";
}
```

Now test your file again using a browser. The ``exports`` expose the functions to other modules that require them. To access the exported functions in out simple server, we can load the greeting module using the require function in ``var greeting = require('./greeting');``. 

As you will see, the core modules give you very few modules. Most of the real power in Node.js is contained in the third party modules available through the Node Package Management system(NPM).
