#Set Up and Configuration

We will use a git repo with a remote for all your lab work using node. We also will be using ES2015 for our Javascript so we need to configure our Node app to transpile ES2015 using Babel.


###Create a Github repo
Create a new repo in *Git Hub* for you labs. Call the repo ``ewd_labs_2017``. Select the following options:
- create a readme.md
- create a .gitignore and select the *Node* option.

We will use this repo for all your lab work using node.

Now clone the new repo onto your laptop/local machine by running the following in a suitable folder: *git clone http://**your_github_domain**/ewd_labs_2017*

You should see the following:

###Lab Setup

Create a new folder called *node_lab1* in your new repo. Open a terminal window in *node_lab1* and enter the following command:

```javascript
npm init
```

You will be prompted for details. Enter the following:


```
name: (node_lab1)
version: (1.0.0) 0.0.1
description: node lab 1
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository: https://your_git_domain/ewd_labs_2017.git
keywords:
author: fxwalsh
license: (ISC)
```

You should now see a ``package.json`` file in the lab folder with these details.

###Scripts

We will be writing our Javascript using ES2015 so we require transcoding before our Node app runs. We need to bring in some babel packages to handle this. Enter the following command to get the relevant babel package and relevant  presets.

``
npm install --save-dev babel-cli
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-2
``

The --save-dev will write this dependency to the development section of the package.json.

To create a node web server, we're going to use Express.js so we need to install this as a normal dependancy.

```
npm install --save express
```

The --save will write this dependency to package.json.


When we change things in a Node.js project, a restart is required for the changes to be reflected in the running process. This can be very time consuming. Instead of manually restarting Node, we will install the ``nodemon`` package, which can monitor our files and auto-restart Node for us when we save changes to disk.

```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

We want to specify a script we want to run for the Node server, which will be the server.js file. So our start script would be ``node server.js``. However, since we want the code to work with babel and nodemon, we want to add a nodemon execution wrapper and use babel-node instead of node.
Modify the package.json file and replace the *scripts* property with the following:

```json
....
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon --exec babel-node server.js"
  },
....
```


Finally, it'd be good to get feedback on the quality of your code as you write it. ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. It kind of tells you if your code looks lousy! Install as follows.

```javascript
npm install eslint babel-eslint
```

Now that we have a our basic setup and configuration complete, this is a good time to commit your changes to git. As in previous labs, change directory to the ewd_labs_2017 folder and do the following:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "set up and configuration"
```

You should see an output indicating only one file was updated. This is because we are ignoring node_modules. We do not need to track changes here as it's contents are speicifed in the package.json.
