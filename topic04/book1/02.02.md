# Create a Mongoose Schema for Contacts

With Mongoose we declare the object structure (or schema) for each collection in the database - this app has only one. In your node-lab3 folder, create the file *api/contact/contactModel.js* and add the following code:
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose'),
Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const ContactSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  address: String,
  age: { type: Number, min: 0, max: 120 },
  email: String,
  updated: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});


export default mongoose.model('contacts', ContactSchema);
```

Schema is a constructor function provided by Mongoose for creating schema instances (ContactSchema). The last line of code above associates the schema instance with a database collection named contacts (MongoDB creates unknown collections automatically, if necessary). The model() method returns a model object, which has special methods for querying and manipulating the associated collection, e.g. find(), findById(), create() etc.
